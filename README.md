Impact of mobile money on savings

This paper was my Masters thesis topic. Does digital financial inclusion through mobile money accounts have an effect on savings in Zimbabwe?

As not many people have access to bank accounts in Africa, I conducting data exploration and logistic regression in python to find out if mobile money has an impact on savings for example emergency savings, savings for farm investment and longterm savings. The findings were that access to mobile money in Zimbabwe increases individuals savings in the short term but not for long term savings such as for retirement.
